## Model Overview

### Introduction

The Img2poem model is a deep neural network that learns how to generate poems from images. For example:

### Architecture

## Getting Started

### Install Required Packages
(It is recommended to install the dependencies under Conda environment.)  
* python2.7  
* tensorflow1.6  
* mxnet  
* opencv  
* scikit-image  
* tqdm  
* colorama  
* flask

### Prepare the Training Data
Both datasets are formatted in JSON files.

MultiM-Poem.json: image and poem pairs

```json
[
    {
        "poem": str,
        "image_url": str,
        "id": int
    },
    ...
]
```

UniM-Poem.json: poem corpus

```json
[
    {
        "poem": str,
        "id": int
    },
    ...
]
```

### Download Trained Model
Please download models from https://1drv.ms/u/s!AkLgJBAHL_VFgSyyfpeGyGFZux56 and put it under "code/".

## Generating Poems
The following command line will generate poem for an image.
```bash
python test.py --input-file input.jpg
```
Example output:
```txt
AAAAA
BBBBB
CCCC
```
Note: you may get different results. Some variation between different models is expected.

## Results
![](results.png)

Here are some examples of poems generated by eight methods for an image.

## Web Demo
We also prepare a web demo, which is more user friendly. To run such demo, please run
```bash
python server.py
```
under "code/src/" folder. Then you can open http://127.0.0.1:5000 to access the it.
