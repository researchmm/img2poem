## Model Overview

### Introduction

The Img2poem model is a deep neural network that learns how to generate poems from images. For example:

### Architecture

## Getting Started

### Install Required Packages
(It is recommended to install the dependencies under Conda environment.)  
* python2.7  
* tensorflow1.6  
* mxnet  
* opencv  
* scikit-image  
* tqdm  
* colorama  
* flask

### Prepare the Training Data

| Name | #Poem | #Line/poem | #Word/line |
| :------:| :------: | :------: | :-----: |
| MultiM-Poem | 8,292 | 7.2 | 5.7 |
| UniM-Poem | 93,265 | 5.7 | 6.2 |
| MultiM-Poem(Ex) | 26,161 | 5.4 | 5.9 |

Both datasets are formatted in JSON files.

MultiM-Poem.json: image and poem pairs

```json
[
    {
        "poem": str,
        "image_url": str,
        "id": int
    },
    ...
]
```

UniM-Poem.json: poem corpus

```json
[
    {
        "poem": str,
        "id": int
    },
    ...
]
```

### Download Trained Model
Please download models from https://1drv.ms/u/s!AkLgJBAHL_VFgSyyfpeGyGFZux56 and put it under "code/".

## Generating Poems
The following command line will generate poem for an image.
```bash
python test.py
```
Type in the relative path to the test image in the console and the poem will be generated.
```bash
../images/test.jpg
```

Example output:
```txt
the sun is singing in the forest wind
and let us go to the wind of the sun
let the sun be free
let us be the storm of heaven
and let us be the slow sun
we keep our own strength together
we live in love and hate
```

## Results

Here are some examples of poems generated by eight methods for an image.
